# Writing and Executing Your First Shell Script in Linux

Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks and executing commands in Linux. Here's a beginner-friendly guide to writing and executing your first shell script.

## Writing Your Script

1. **Choose a Text Editor**: Open your preferred text editor. Common choices include `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit`.

2. **Create a New File**: Start a new file by typing:
    ```bash
    nano my_script.sh
    ```
    Replace `my_script.sh` with your desired file name.

3. **Add SheBang**: Begin your script with a SheBang line to specify the shell interpreter. For bash, use:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ```

4. **Write Your Commands**: Add the commands you want your script to execute. For example:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    echo "Hello, world!"
    ```

5. **Save and Exit**: Press `Ctrl + X` to exit nano. Confirm to save changes by typing `Y`, then press `Enter`.

## Making Your Script Executable

1. **Set Permissions**: Make your script executable using the `chmod` command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x my_script.sh
    ```

## Executing Your Script

1. **Run Your Script**: Execute your script using the `./` notation followed by the script name:
    ```bash
    ./my_script.sh
    ```

2. **View Output**: Your script's output will be displayed in the terminal.

## Example

Here's an example of a simple shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, world!"
