# Shell Scripting in Linux [Square]

## Introduction
Shell scripting in Linux refers to the process of writing and executing scripts using the command-line shell of a Unix-like operating system. In Linux, the default shell is typically GNU Bash (Bourne Again Shell), although other shells such as Zsh (Z shell) and Dash are also commonly used.

Shell scripts allow users to automate tasks, execute commands, manipulate files and directories, and perform various system administration tasks in a convenient and efficient manner. These scripts are essentially a series of commands and constructs written in a scripting language interpreted by the shell.

## Features
- **Automation**: Shell scripts can automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
- **Flexibility**: They provide flexibility in executing commands, combining them with conditional statements, loops, and functions.
- **File Manipulation**: Shell scripts can manipulate files and directories, such as creating, copying, moving, and deleting them.
- **System Administration**: They are widely used in system administration for tasks like managing users, configuring services, and monitoring system resources.
- **Customization**: Users can customize and extend shell scripts to suit their specific needs and workflows.
